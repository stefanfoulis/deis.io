<p>The Deis project is psyched to announce our v0.2.0 release. We've added support for DigitalOcean Cloud, improved our Installation docs, updated Chef, and fixed many issues found by the Deis community.</p>
<h2>What is Deis?</h2>
<p>Deis is a Django/Celery API server, Python CLI and set of <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/deis-cookbook">Chef cookbooks</a> that combine to provide a Heroku-inspired application platform for public and private clouds. Your PaaS. Your Rules.</p>
<h2>0.2.0 Summary</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>DigitalOcean Cloud provider support</li>
<li>New Installation docs for EC2, Rackspace, and DigitalOcean</li>
<li>Updated controller web UI</li>
</ul>
<h3>Under the Hood</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chef updated to v.11.6.2</li>
<li>Updated some Ruby and Chef libraries</li>
<li>Updated EC2 AMIs for faster provisioning</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed socket.hostname issue that prevented controller restart</li>
<li>Fixed <code>deis open</code> text output</li>
<li>Fixed <code>git push deis master</code> bug with PHP buildpack</li>
<li>Fixed <code>deis logs</code> sometimes returning 404s</li>
<li>Fixed issues with <code>deis create</code> and explicit --id flag</li>
</ul>
<h3>Community Shout-Outs</h3>
<p>We want to thank the following Deis community members for creating GitHub issues, providing support to others, and working on various Deis branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>@bacongobbler - DigitalOcean has arrived, and it's thanks to his hard work. Try it out! And Matt's continued help on IRC and GitHub is invaluable.</li>
<li>@enyachoke - Vagrant support request and feedback.</li>
<li>@tombh - Vagrant support--with <code>deis nodes:scale</code>--seemed nearly impossible, but Tom found a way. This will land in master soon and enable testing and development on Deis without any cloud provider charges.</li>
<li>@scottstamp - Bug finding, bug fixing!</li>
<li>@jeff-french - Testing and feature requests.</li>
<li>@zodman, @mkuklis, @BrianHicks,@ianthedeveloper, @wiemann, @arkan, @luislavena, @cpursley, @nikolay, @Qard, @wingrunr21, @kylefinley, @phildini, @Imdsm - DigitalOcean testing and feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Vagrant provider</em></strong>. Allowing Deis to run on a completely local "cloud" will enable developers to test and improve Deis without incurring any provider charges. This works in a "static" node formation currently, but @tombh has a complete Vagrant provider implementation branch that is currently in testing.</li>
<li><strong><em>Team Support / Sharing</em></strong>. The mechanisms for sharing Formations and Apps are already implemented in a branch; we need to write more tests, implement some access control endpoints and make some changes to the gitosis data bag.</li>
<li><strong><em>Improved Documentation</em></strong> There are a few items that require better documentation including how to setup a static formation on bare metal.  We also need to provide a Tutorial that walks through advanced usage of the CLI, including how to create custom layers.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Future</h2>
<h3>Enhanced Docker Integration</h3>
<p>Deis currently uses Docker as a LXC wrapper for running Heroku Buildpack slugs that are bind-mounted into <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/buildstep">Buildstep</a> images. As soon as the Docker Private Registry code stabilizes, we will be adding a new <code>git push</code> build process that creates and distributes images via <code>Dockerfile</code> and a private registry hosted on the controller.</p>
<h3>General Security Improvements</h3>
<p>Both the controller and formation proxies require SSL configuration. Right now controller sessions are just HTTP with cookies and passwords sent in the clear! We've also glossed over some pretty important security features in an effort to get Deis into developers hands. For example, we need to implement iptables host-level firewalls, improve security group default rules, use Chef recipes to harden systems, etc. If you find any other security holes, please <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues">open a GitHub issue</a> and tag it "Security".</p>
<h3>Health Checks</h3>
<p>We do not currently monitor nodes or container health -- though we have infrastructure in place to do it.</p>
<h3>Service Registry</h3>
<p>We need to make it as easy for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc) and allow developers to attach those services to applications. This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices.</p>
