<p><strong><em>We are happy to share this guest blog post by Matt Fisher (<a href="https://twitter.com/bacongobbler">@bacongobbler</a>).</em></strong></p>
<p>...Thanks to new emerging technologies like Configuration Management tools, Platform as a Service layers, and the push for companies to adopt a DevOps approach to their solutions, IT orchestration and application management got a hell of a lot easier. One of these new tools that leverage both containerization and configuration management in their workflow is <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/deis">Deis</a>.</p>
<p>As of commit <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/deis/commit/1ca8d840f5">1ca8d840f5</a>, DigitalOcean clustering support has been added, so you can have your own mini-Heroku on DigitalOcean! The documentation for getting your own cluster set up on DigitalOcean can be found here. This post will (hopefully!) help give you a basic overview on how easy it is to deploy a cluster on DigitalOcean.</p>
